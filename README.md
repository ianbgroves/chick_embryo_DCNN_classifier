# Code for the paper 'Accurate staging of chick embryonic tissues via deep learning'.

[Here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wH53iao1chYqNcCUbx7cXNvgCMm0gRFT?usp=sharing) is the Colab notebook where you can train DCNNs on your own data 


# Installation:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) and [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/postdownload.html?&L=0)
2. Clone the repository
3. From the command line, cd to the repository e.g. ```cd documents/github/chick_embryo_DCNN_classifier```
4. run ```conda create --name chick_dcnn_classifier python=3.10```
5. run ```conda activate chick_dcnn_classifier```
6. run ```pip install --no-deps -r requirements.txt``` to install all packages needed.

# Neural network training (Tables 1, S2-3 tables)

Use the following tags for the different augmentation regimes described in the paper.


*   ```--baseline``` for 'Baseline' 
*  ```--cutout``` for 'Cutout'
*   ```--shear``` for 'Shear
*   ```--gblur``` for 'Gaussian Blur'
*   ```--crop``` for 'Crop'
*   ```--randcomb``` for '1+2/4/5 RC in Table 1'
*   ```--allcomb``` for '1+2+4+5 RC in Table 1'
*   ```--mobius``` for 'MÃ¶bius transformations'


For our model, run  (e.g.)

```rb
python training_brain.py -exp training_test --baseline
```

Or, for InceptionV3/ResNet50 re-training (Table S2), set either the resnet/inception booleans to true by running (e.g.) 

```rb
python training_brain.py -exp resnet_test --baseline --resnet
``` 

For retraining the brain classifier on the wing bud dataset (Table 1), first the brain model needs to be unzipped using WinRAR - as Github doesn't allow hosting of single files >100MB.\
Select 'final_model.part1' and 'final_model.part2' (etc.) and select WinRAR > extract to "final_model\"

Then, run
```rb
python transfer_learning_wing.py
```

# Saliency analysis (Figs 3 and 5)

For brain saliency analyses (Fig 3), compile final model part 1 and 2 as above.
Then, run 
```rb
python saliency_brain.py
```

For wing saliency analysis (Fig 5), compile 'limb_final_model.part1/2' as above.
Then, run
```rb
python saliency_limb.py
```

# In situ prediction (Fig 4)

For the inference on brightfield images paired to in situ hybridisation analyses, run 

```rb
python in_situ_predict.py
```

# Supplementary Figs and tables
For the unsupervised clustering (Fig S1)

```rb
python pca_k_means.py
```
For the unsupervised clustering on Haralick features (Fig S2)
```rb
python feature_extraction.py
```

Traditional classifiers (Support vector machine, K nearest neighbours, Random Forest classifier, S1 Table)

```rb
training_traditional_clf.py
```
